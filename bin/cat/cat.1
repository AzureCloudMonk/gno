.TH CAT 1 "August 1997" "GNO" "Commands and Applications"
.SH NAME
.BR cat
\- concatenate and print files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR cat " [" -benstuv ]
.IR file \0...
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR cat
utility reads files sequentially, writing them to the standard output.
The
.IR file
operands are processed in command line order.
A single dash represents the standard input.
.LP
.SS OPTIONS
.IP \fB-b\fR
Implies the
.B "-n"
option but doesn't number blank lines.
.IP \fB-e\fR
Implies the
.B "-v"
option, and displays a dollar sign (\fB$\fR)
at the end of each line
as well.
.IP \fB-n\fR
Number the output lines, starting at 1.
.IP \fB-s\fR
Squeeze multiple adjacent empty lines, causing the output to be
single spaced.
.IP \fB-t\fR
Implies the
.B -v
option, and displays tab characters as
.B ^I
as well.
.IP \fB-u\fR
The
.B -u
option guarantees that the output is unbuffered.
.IP \fB-v\fR
Displays non-printing characters so they are visible.
Control characters print as
.B ^X
for control-X; the delete
character (octal 0177) prints as
.B ^?
Non-ascii characters (with the high bit set) are printed as
.B M-
(for meta) followed by the character for the low 7 bits.
.RE
.LP
The
.BR cat
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
.SH WARNINGS
Because of the shell language mechanism used to perform output
redirection, the command
.IP
.B "cat file1 file2 > file1"
.PP
will cause the original data in file1 to be destroyed!
Instead use
.IP
.B "cat file2 >> file1"
.SH VERSION
This manual page documents

version 2.0.
