.SH NAME
gsh \- GNO Shell
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gsh
[
.B -f
] [
.BI -c " commands"
] [
.I scriptfile
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR gsh
is the GNO Shell, so named because it was the first (and currently only)
shell to be made GNO-compatible.
It is the program which acts as the interface between the user and the
GNO kernel and various programs.
For a more complete description of
.BR gsh ,
see the
.IR "GNO Shell User's Manual" .
.LP
If
.IR scriptfile
is specified, it is assumed to be a 
.BR gsh
shell script contained in a file of type SRC and auxtype EXEC.
The script is executed and then
.BR gsh
exits.
.LP
If
.BR -c " commands"
is specified,
.IR commands
is assumed to be a series of
.BR gsh
commands which are then executed as if they had been contained in a
.IR scriptfile .
See the section on BUGS, below.
.LP
If neither
.IR scriptfile
nor the
.BR -c
flag is specified, then 
.BR gsh
starts up in interactive mode.  In this case,
.BR gsh
will execute commands entered by the user until it gets the 
.BR exit (1)
command, an EOF, or gets killed by another process.
.LP
The 
.BR -f 
flag indicates that on startup,
.BR gsh
should not attempt to parse the 
.BR gshrc
file or do other initializations.  This is intended to give a fast startup
in situations where these initializations are not required, however see
the section on BUGS, below.
.SH BUGS
The
.BR -c
flag does not work as advertised and may crash your machine if it is used.
.LP
Empirical tests are inconclusive as to whether or not the
.BR -f
flag really does speed up the starting of
.BR gsh .
.LP
Unfortunately, there are currently
.I many
other bugs in
.BR gsh .

.BR http://www.gno.org/~gno/bugs.html .
