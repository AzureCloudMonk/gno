.SH NAME
.LP
cd \- change working directory (gsh builtin)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.B cd
[
.I directory
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.I directory
becomes the new working directory.
If
.B cd
is used without arguments, it returns you
to your $HOME directory.
.LP
Because a new process is created to execute each command,
.B cd
would be ineffective if it were written as a normal command.  It is therefore
recognized and executed by the shells. 
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.LP
.BR pwd (1)
