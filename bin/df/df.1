.TH DF 1 "04 August 1997" GNO "Commands and Applications"
.SH NAME
.BR df
\- display free disk space and disk usage statistics
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR df " [" -k "] [" -t
.IR "FST list"
]
.IR devnum
|
.IR vol
|
.IR file ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
displays statistics about the amount of free disk space on the
specified device number
.IR devnum
(.d##), on the specified volume 
.IR vol
or on the volume of which
.IR file
is a part.  More than one device number, volume, or file may be
listed, and types can be mixed in the argument list.
.LP
Values are displayed in 512-byte per block block counts.
If neither a file or a filesystem operand is specified,
statistics for all mounted filesystems are displayed.
Devices without valid media (e.g. a 3.5" disk drive with
no disk in the drive) are not included in the output.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are available:
.IP \fB-k\fR
Use 1024-byte (1-Kbyte) blocks rather than the default.  Note
that this overrides the
.BR BLOCKSIZE
specification from the environment.
.IP "\fB-t\fR \fIfst1,...,fstN\fR"
Only print out statistics for filesystems of the specified types.
More than one type may be specified in a comma separated list.
The list of filesystem types can be prefixed with
.IR no
to specify the filesystem types for which action should
not be taken.
.LP
For example, the
.BR df
command:
.nf
	df -t nohfs,msdos
.fi
lists all filesystems except those of type
.IR HFS
and
.IR MS-DOS
.LP
Acceptable filesystem types are as follows:
.IP
prodos, dos33, dos32, pascal, mfs, hfs, lisa, cpm,
msdos, highsierra, iso9660, appleshare.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.IP \fBBLOCKSIZE\fR
If the environment variable
.BR BLOCKSIZE
is set, the block counts will be displayed in units of that size block.
.SH HISTORY
.BR df
for GNO/ME was originally built-in to gsh(1).  The implementation of
.BR df
is based on FreeBSD source code and distributed with GNO/ME v2.0.6
