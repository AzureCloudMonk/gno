.SH NAME
.BR center
\- print centered text to stdout
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR center
.I columns
.I file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR center
is a simple utility for centering text on a screen.
.I columns
is the number of columns that are considered to be the width of a full screen.
The default and maximum widths are both 80 columns.
Text is read from the input file
.I file
and printed to stdout.
.SH BUGS
.B center 
should be able to read from stdin.
.LP
.B center
would be more useful if it took arbitrary screen widths into account,
including over 80 columns.  Less than about 5 or 10 is probably unnecessary.
