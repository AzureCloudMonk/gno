tee \- Pipe fitting.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tee
[
.I -aviV
]
.I file1
[
.IR file2 ...
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B tee
utility copies standard input to standard
output, making a copy in
.IR file1 ,
.IR file2 ,
etc.
The standard output is by default unbuffered, while output to the
.IR file s
is fully buffered
.LP          
The following options are available:
.RS
.IP "\fI-a\fR
Append the output to the
.IR file s
rather than overwriting them.
.IP \fI-b\fR
Use line buffering on stdin and stdout.  By default, there is no buffering
on these two streams.
.IP \fI-i\fR
Ignore the SIGINT signal.
.IP \fI-V\fR
Show version and usage information, then exit.
.RE
.LP
The
.B tee
utility takes the default action for all
signals, except in the event of the
.I -i
option.
.LP
If an error occurs while reading stdin, only the first specified
.I file
will contain the output up to that point.
.LP          
The return value is 0 on success, and 1 if an error
occurs.
.SH STANDARDS
.B Tee
is POSIX p1003.2 compatible.
