tee v1.1 for Gno

The tee that ships with Gno (and hereforth designated v1.0) seems to have
buffered output, making it next to useless.  This one has no buffering on
stdout, so you see the output as it's being read.  This one also allows
multiple output files, appending, and ignoring of SIGINT.

To install copy tee to /bin and tee.1 to /usr/man/man1, or just type
"dmake install".
