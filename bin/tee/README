tee v1.2 for Gno

The tee that ships with Gno (and hereforth designated v1.0) seems to have
fully buffered output, making it next to useless.  This version of tee
has no buffering on stdin/stdout by default, so you see the output as
it's being read.  This version also allows multiple output files, appending,
and ignoring of SIGINT.

To install copy tee to /bin and tee.1 to /usr/man/man1, or just type
"dmake install".
