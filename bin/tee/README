tee v1.3 for GNO

The tee that shiped with GNO v2.0.4 (and hereforth designated v1.0) seems
to have fully buffered output, making it next to useless.  This version of
tee has no buffering on stdin/stdout by default, so you see the output as
it's being read.  This version also allows multiple output files, appending,
and ignoring of SIGINT.
