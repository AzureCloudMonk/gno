.TH TEST 1 "19 October 1997" GNO "Commands and Applications"
.SH NAME
test \- Condition evaluation utility.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B test
.I expression
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B test
utility evaluates the expression and, if it evaluates
to true, returns a zero (true) exit status; otherwise
it returns 1 (false).
If there is no expression, test also
returns 1 (false).
.LP
All operators and flags are separate arguments to the
.B test
utility.
.LP
The following primaries are used to construct
.IR expression :
.IP "\fB-b\fR \fIfile\fR"
True if
.I file
exists and is a block special
file.
.IP "\fB-c\fR \fIfile\fR"
True if
.I file
exists and is a character
special file.
.IP "\fB-d\fR \fIfile\fR"
True if
.I file
exists and is a directory.
.IP "\fB-e\fR \fIfile\fR"
True if
.I file
exists (regardless of type).
.IP "\fB-f\fR \fIfile\fR"
True if
.I file
exists and is a regular file.
.IP "\fB-g\fR \fIfile\fR"
True if
.I file
exists and its set group ID flag
is set.
.IP "\fB-n\fR \fIstring\fR"
True if the length of
.I string
is nonzero.
.IP "\fB-p\fR \fIfile\fR"
True if
.I file
is a named pipe (FIFO).
.IP "\fB-r\fR \fIfile\fR"
True if
.I file
exists and is readable.
.IP "\fB-s\fR \fIfile\fR"
True if
.I file
exists and has a size greater
than zero.
.IP "\fB-t\fR [ \fIfile_descriptor\fR ]"
True if the file whose file descriptor number
is
.I file_descriptor
(default 1) is open and is
associated with a terminal.
.IP "\fB-u\fR \fIfile\fR"
True if
.I file
exists and its set user ID flag
is set.
.IP "\fB-w\fR \fIfile\fR"
True if
.I file
exists and is writable.
True
indicates only that the write flag is on.
The file is not writable on a read-only file
system even if this test indicates true.
.IP "\fB-x\fR \fIfile\fR"
True if
.I file
exists and is executable.
True
indicates only that the execute flag is on.
If
.I file
is a directory, true indicates that
.I file
can be searched.
.IP "\fB-z\fR \fIstring\fR"
True if the length of
.I string
is zero.
.IP "\fIstring\fR"
True if
.I string
is not the null
string.
.IP "\fIs1\fR \fB=\fR \fIs2\fR"
True if the strings
.I s1
and
.I s2
are identical.
.IP "\fIs1\fR \fB!=\fR \fIs2\fR"
True if the strings
.I s1
and
.I s2
are not identical.
.IP "\fIn1\fR \fB-eq\fR \fIn2\fR"
True if the integers
.I n1
and
.I n2
are algebraically
equal.
.IP "\fIn1\fR \fB-ne\fR \fIn2\fR"
True if the integers
.I n1
and
.I n2
are not
algebraically equal.
.IP "\fIn1\fR \fB-gt\fR \fIn2\fR"
True if the integer
.I n1
is algebraically
greater than the integer
.I n2 .
.IP "\fIn1\fR \fB-ge\fR \fIn2\fR"
True if the integer
.I n1
is algebraically
greater than or equal to the integer
.I n2 .
.IP "\fIn1\fR \fB-lt\fR \fIn2\fR"
True if the integer
.I n1
is algebraically less
than the integer
.I n2 .
.IP "\fIn1\fR \fB-le\fR \fIn2\fR"
True if the integer
.I n1
is algebraically less
than or equal to the integer
.I n2 .
.LP
These primaries can be combined with the following operators:
.IP "\fB!\fR \fIexpression\fR"
True if
.I expression
is false.
.IP "\fIexpression1\fR \fB-a\fR \fIexpression2\fR"
True if both
.I expression1
and
.I expression2
are true.
.IP "\fIexpression1\fR \fB-o\fR \fIexpression2\fR"
True if either
.I expression1
or
.I expression2
are true.
.IP "\fB\&(\fR \fIexpression\fR \fB\&)\fR"
True if
.I expression
is true.
.LP
The
.B -a
operator has higher precedence than the
.B -o
operator.
.SH GRAMMAR AMBIGUITY
The 
.B test
grammar is inherently ambiguous.  In order to assure a degree of consistency,
the cases described in the 
.IR "POSIX 1003.2" , 
section D11.2/4.62.4, standard
are evaluated consistently according to the rules specified in the
standards document.  All other cases are subject to the ambiguity in the
command semantics.
.SH GNO CAVEATS
The
.BR \-b ,
.BR \-c ,
.BR \-g ,
and
.BR \-u
operators always cause a false return value (as of GNO v2.0.4)
since block- and character-special files, and the setuid and setgid bits
are not currently available under GS/OS.
.LP
Because of the implementation of
.BR stat (2)
under GNO v2.0.4, the
.BR \-x
operator will return false if
.I file
is a directory.
.SH RETURN VALUES
The
.B test
utility exits with one of the following values:
.IP \fB0\fR
.I expression
evaluated to true.
.IP \fB1\fR
.I expression
evaluated to false or expression was missing.
.IP \fB>1\fR
An error occurred.
.SH AUTHOR
This code is derived from software contributed to Berkeley by
Kenneth Almquist, and is based on BSD
.BR test
version 5.4.
.LP
The GNO port of
.BR test
was done by Devin Reade, <gdr@gno.org>.
.SH STANDARDS
The
.B test
function is expected to be
.I "POSIX 1003.2"
compatible.
