.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR kill
utility sends a signal to the processes specified by the
.IR pid
operand(s).
.PP
The options are as follows:
.IP "\fB-s\fR \fIsignal_name\fR"
A symbolic signal name specifying the signal to be sent instead of the
default
.BR TERM .
.IP "\fB-l\fR [\fIexit_status\fR]"
If no operand is given, list the signal names; otherwise, write
the signal name corresponding to
.IR exit_status .
.IP \fB-\fIsignal_name\fR
A symbolic signal name specifying the signal to be sent instead of the
default
.BR TERM .
.IP \fB-\fIsignal_number\fR
A non-negative decimal integer, specifying the signal to be sent instead
of the default
.BR TERM .
.PP
See the
.BR kill (2)
man page for information on
.IR pid s
that have special meanings.

.BR 31
USR2 (user defined signal 2)
.RE
.PP
.BR kill
is a built-in to
.BR gsh (1);
it allows job specifiers of the form ``%...'' as arguments
so process id's are not as often used as
.BR kill
arguments.
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR gsh (1),
.BR ps (1),
.BR kill (2),
.BR signal (2)
.SH STANDARDS
The
.BR kill
function is expected to be
POSIX-2
compatible.
.SH VERSION
This manual page documents
.BR kill
version 1.0.
.SH ATTRIBUTIONS
This command was ported from FreeBSD source code
for distribution with GNO/ME 2.0.6.
