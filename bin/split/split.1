.TH SPLIT 1 "November 1997" "GNO" "Commands and Applications"
.SH NAME
.BR split
\- split a file into pieces
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR split
.RB [ -b
.IR byte_count\c
.RB [ k | m ]]
.RB [ -l
.IR line_count ]
.RI [ file " [" name ]]
.PP
.I Obsolescent:
.PP
.BR split
.RB [ -\c
.IR line_count ]
.RI [ file " [" name ]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR split
utility reads the given
.IR file
(or standard input if no file is specified)
and breaks it up into files of 1000 lines each.
.PP
The options are as follows:
.RS
.IP \fB-b\fR
Create smaller files
.IR byte_count
bytes in length.
If
.BR k
is appended to the number, the file is split into
.IR byte_count
kilobyte pieces.
If
.BR m
is appended to the number, the file is split into
.IR byte_count
megabyte pieces.
.IP \fB-l\fR
Create smaller files
.IR line_count
lines in length.
.RE
.PP
If additional arguments are specified, the first is used as the name
of the input file which is to be split.
If a second additional argument is specified, it is used as a prefix
for the names of the files into which the file is split.
In this case, each file into which the file is split is named by the
prefix followed by a lexically ordered suffix in the range of 
.BR aa-zz .
.PP
If the
.IR name
argument is not specified, the file is split into lexically ordered
files named in the range of
.BR xaa - zzz .
.SH BUGS
For historical reasons, if you specify
.IR name ,
.BR split
can only create 676 separate
files.
The default naming convention allows 2028 separate files.
.SH VERSION
This manual page documents
.BR split
version 2.0.
.SH ATTRIBUTIONS
This command was ported from FreeBSD source code
for distribution with GNO/ME 2.0.6.
.SH HISTORY
A version of
.BR split
written in 1992 was distributed with
earlier releases of GNO.
