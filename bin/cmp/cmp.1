.SH NAME
.BR cmp
\- compare two files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR cmp " [" -l " | " -s "] ["
.BR -r
]
.IR file1
.IR file2
[
.IR skip1
[
.IR skip2
] ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR cmp
utility compares two files of any type and writes the results
to the standard output.
By default,
.BR cmp
is silent if the files are the same; if they differ, the byte
and line number at which the first difference occurred is reported.
Also by default, 
.BR cmp
also considers the resource forks of the files, and will make note
if only one of the files has a resource fork.
.PP
Bytes and lines are numbered beginning with one.
.PP
The following options are available:
.IP \fB-l\fR
Print the byte number (decimal) and the differing
byte values (octal) for each difference.
.IP \fB-s\fR
Print nothing for differing files; return exit
status only.
.IP \fB-r\fR
Ignore resource forks when comparing.
.PP
The optional arguments
.IR skip1
and 
.IR skip2
are the byte offsets from the beginning of
.IR file1
and
.IR file2 ,
respectively, where the comparison will begin.
The offset is decimal by default, but may be expressed as an hexadecimal
or octal value by preceding it with a leading ``0x'' or ``0''.
.PP
The
.BR cmp
utility exits with one of the following values:
.IP \fB0\fR
The files are identical.
.IP \fB1\fR
The files are different; this includes the case
where one file is identical to the first part of
the other.
In the latter case, if the
.IR -s
option has not been specified,
.BR cmp
writes to standard output that EOF was reached in the shorter
file (before any differences were found).
.IP \fB>1\fR
An error occurred.
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR diff(1),
.BR diff3(1)
.SH HISTORY
The 
.BR cmp
command for GNO/ME v2.0.6 is based on FreeBSD source code.
