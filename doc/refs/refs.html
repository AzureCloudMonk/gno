These documents are based on Procyon's August 1996 v2.0.4 documents, but have
been updated and enhanced. <em>These manuals are still being revised;

<dt><A HREF="%%HTML_ROOT%%/intro.html">Overview and Installation</A>
<dd>This document contains introductory information (including how
to obtain GNO), installation
instructions, a list of hardware requirements, suggested readings,
and similar material.  It is a good starting point for those new to GNO.

<dt><A HREF="%%HTML_ROOT%%/unaval.html">GNO Shell User's Manual</A>

<h3>Note on A4 Paper Formats</h3>
</A>
Since I do not use the A4 paper format, I would be interested
in feedback on how the formatting turns out.  Currently, the 
DVI files are created for the the letter paper size, and only
in the DVI to Postscript conversion is the A4 paper size taken
into account.  While this greatly simplifies the document
&quot;build&quot; process, it might result in less than desirable
output.  Please email your observations to me at the address at
the bottom of this page.
