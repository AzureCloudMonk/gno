<H1>GNO Bug Reports</H1>
<hr>

A critical part of GNO development is user feedback.  What works
well?  What needs improvement?  What is broken?
By telling GNO developers this information, you are <em>much</em>
more likely to see improvements.
<p>

The traditional method of sending in bug reports is to email the
developer.  While this mechanism is simple, it has a few drawbacks:
<ul>
<li>Sometimes the original author has moved or is otherwise no longer around,
	making it impossible (or at least difficult) to submit bug reports.
<li>Only the author sees the report.  Consequently nobody else knows of
	the problem, which can result in unnecessary frusteration and
	wasted time for other users.
</ul>

The GNO Consortium now provides a common bug reporting and tracking system.
While it is primarily intended for bug reports on the GNO base distribution,
reports are also welcome on programs that are not part of the base
distribution (but that still run under GNO).  This system is accessible
both though the web and through email.

<H3>Bug Reports -- Web Access</H3>

The recommended way to submit GNO bug reports is to use the web-based
bug reporting package.  There are two ways to access this system:
<ul>
<li><A HREF="http://www.gno.org/cgi-bin/gnobugs">Guest Access</A>.
	This will allow you to submit, update, and view problem
	reports, but not perform any other operations.
<li><A HREF="http://www.gno.org/cgi-bin/secure/gnobugs">Developer Access</A>.
	This allows full access to the problem report system, but
	is restricted to a small number of &quot;core&quot; developers.
	If you feel you should have developer access, you should send
	email to
	<A HREF="mailto:gno-bugs-admin@trenco.gno.org">
	gno-bugs-admin@trenco.gno.org</A>.
	Please do not feel insulted if you are not granted access.
</ul>
Note that this reporting system is accessible from Lynx, but is more
readable using a graphical browser.  This is unfortunate, but fixing
this problem will require modifications to the bug tracking software
itself.  This will be addressed when time permits.

<hr>
<H3>Bug Reports -- Email Access</H3>

If you prefer to send your bug reports via regular email, you can 
send them to 
<A HREF="mailto:gno-bugs@trenco.gno.org">gno-bugs@trenco.gno.org</A>.
If you do this method, please ensure that your subject line contains
a concise description of the problem, such as
<pre>
	open(2) doesn't set errno
or
	rm broken for HFS volumes
</pre>
<p>

When sending your bug reports in email, please also include the following
information, in addition to your informative subject line:
<ul>
<li>With which distribution did you observe the problem?  It should be
	one of the following:
	<ul>
	<li> the base 2.0.4 distribution
	<li> the v2.0.4 kernel with v2.0.6 libraries
	<li> beta 2.0.6
	</ul>
<li>Which component is affected?  It should be one of the following:
	<ul>
	<li>Documentation
	<li>Utilities
	<li>The GNO Shell
	<li>The Kernel
	<li>Libraries and Header Files
	<li>other
	</ul>
<li>If you are reporting a problem with a utility or library routine,
	include the name of the utility (or routine).  If it's available,
	also quote the version.  This is often given as an rVersion 
	resource on programs and libraries.
<li>Give a clear description of the problem.  If possible, include
	precise instructions on how to reproduce the problem.
<li>If your problem is with a library routine, give a <em>short</em>
	program which exhibits the problem.
<li>If your program is longer
	than one hundred or so, then you can upload the program to
	<b>ftp://ftp.gno.org/incoming</b>, preferably as a NuFX (Shrinkit)
	archive.  Please include a brief description with your upload.
	The description can either be included in the NuFX archive or
	uploaded as a separate text file.
</ul>
<p>

Note that bug reports to the above address will go straight into 
the reporting system.  If your bug report contains proprietary information,
you should send it to
<A HREF="mailto:gno-bugs-admin@trenco.gno.org">
gno-bugs-admin@trenco.gno.org</A>
