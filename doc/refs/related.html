The following links are also likely to be of interest to GNO users
and programmers.

<ul>
<li>The <A HREF="http://www.gno.org/~gno/describe">

	on current GNO and ORCA/Shell utilities, including version numbers
	and from where they can be obtained.

The following links have a less direct relevance to GNO, but may still
be useful:
<ul>
<li><A HREF="http://earthspace.net/~esr/writings/cathedral-paper.html">
	The Cathedral and the Bazaar</A>
	by Eric S. Raymond.
	This paper discusses differences between two software engineering
	strategies:  The traditional development / testing / release
	cycle and the high turn-around cycle typified by Linux and
	one of the author's own projects, <b>fetchmail</b>.
	This paper is valuable as &quot;food for thought&quot; for anyone
	considering working on GNO or any other large projects for the
	Apple II.<p>

<li>The <A HREF="http://www.pathname.com/fhs">File System Hierarchy</A>
	&quot;standard&quot;.  This is not a true standard in the ANSI/ISO
	sense, but still contains a lot of useful information.
	<b>NOTE:</b> <em>GNO is based on 4.4BSD which does not, at this
	time, completely follow the suggested hierarchy.  GNO sites
	should use the hierarchy specified in the
	<A HREF="%%FAQ%%">FAQ</A>. </em>
