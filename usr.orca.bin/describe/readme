About Describe
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  First off: make sure the directory /usr/local/lib exists!!!

  This is yet another project I've been sitting on for a while, but have
finally decided to release.  The basic idea of the 'describe' package
(the descc "compiler" and describe itself) is to provide a quick, easy
way of accessing information related to the utilities which so many
different people are releasing these days.  The reason it sat around on
my harddrive so long is I was having qualms about its designated role in
life.  I wasn't sure exactly what I wanted it to do.  Well, I've decided
to KISS for now: descc simply compiles the utility list, which I maintain,
into a (very) simple "database" located in /usr/local/lib/.  The companion
utility 'describe' is used to fetch information about a particular utility
from this "database".

   descc is fairly limited, as is the "database" format itself.  Part of the
KISS (or it wouldn't be out now) design philosophy ;).  Usage is simple:
when you get a new listing (I'll provide monthly updates), simply "descc
<filename>" where <filename> is the name of the newly released update.
descc will simply write over the old database and replace it with the
new (note: no appendages allowed).

   As always, coments are appreciated.  And, moreso than on other projects,
I'd appreciate some comments about the direction I'm going in, suggestions
as to where to take this, etc.  I have a feeling that some fields in the
format (eg, FTP:) are rather useless, and I'd like to know what you guys
out there think.
