=============================================================================

Udl converts text files between CR, LF and CR/LF (Apple, Unix and MS-DOS).
It is a very fast utility that ensures that the integrity of the file
cannot be compromised during the translation.  It is also much easier
to use than tr(1).

Revision History:
================

v1.0.1
	Tabs are left alone now. Also recognizes CR/LF (MeSsy-DOS).

v1.0.2
	Does no longer read in the complete file, instead creates a temp
	file in prefix 3/.

v1.0.3
	Fixed a bug, allocated not enough mem for strncpy.

v1.1
	Changed to use static GS/OS strings again. Made faster by factor
	5.8.

v1.1.1
	Cleaned the code up a bit, wrote a Makefile, all output by udl is
	prefixed with the name it was invoked with.

v1.1.2
	Sped up Apple <-> Unix conversion further (factor 1.5).

v1.1.2 (Unix)
	(December 1993)
	Modified source to produce a Unix version

v1.1.3
	(Updated by Devin Reade, November 1994)
	Added ability to recurse through directories (-R flag).
	Changed behavior to ignore binary files rather than exiting.
	Merged Unix and Apple IIgs versions.
        No message is printed out when a binary file (or, in the IIgs
           implementation, a non-TXT or non-SRC file) is encountered
           unless the -v option is specified.

v1.1.4
	(Soenke Behrens, Devin Reade, February 1995)
	udl creates a temporary file in the directory of the
	   source file, not in /tmp. This reduces the likelihood of
	   data loss in the event of a system crash or powerdown.
	udl now accepts something like "udl -R directory/" without
	   affixing an extra '/' to "directory/".
	Fixed bug (via the BROKEN_DIRENT_STRUCT macro) that was causing
	   filename-munging on Solaris.  It seems that the sys/stat.h header
	   file doesn't agree with the stat implementation.
	Modified Makefile.gs to properly write the new executable over
	   the old resource fork for udl.  The resource fork originates with
	   the file udl.r.
	Added suggested defines to the README for various Unix platforms.
	Man page changes, including grammar and the deletion of a bug that
	   no longer exists.
	Fixed bug where invoking 'udl -u directory' would attempt to
	   deref a NULL pointer, causing either memory tromping (IIgs) or
	   a core dump (Unix).
	Tested under SunOS 4.x, SunOS 5.x (Solaris), and AIX.

v1.1.5
	(Soenke Behrens, Devin Reade, January 1996)
	Changed source slightly to compile under djgpp (MS-DOS) and Linux,
        linted source
        Unix makefile changed by Devin Reade to automatically detect OS
        type
        Apple IIgs source now opens files with "r+b" instead of "rwb"
