udl -	Convert EOL formats freely between MS-DOS (CR/LF), Unix/Amiga (LF),
     	and Apple (CR).

=============================================================================

Udl converts text files between CR, LF and CR/LF (Apple, Unix and MS-DOS).
It is a very fast utility that ensures that the integrity of the file
cannot be compromised during the translation.  It is also much easier
to use than tr(1).

================
Revision History:
================

v1.01
	Tabs are left alone now. Also recognizes CR/LF (MeSsy-DOS).

v1.02
	Does no longer read in the complete file, instead creates a temp
	file in prefix 3/.

v1.03
	Fixed a bug, allocated not enough mem for strncpy.

v1.1
	Changed to use static GS/OS strings again. Made faster by factor
	5.8.

v1.11
	Cleaned the code up a bit, wrote a Makefile, all output by udl is
	prefixed with the name it was invoked with.

v1.12
	Sped up Apple <-> Unix conversion further (factor 1.5).

v1.12 (Unix)
	(December 1993)
	Modified source to produce a Unix version

v1.13
	(Updated by Devin Reade, November 1994)
	Added ability to recurse through directories (-R flag).
	Changed behavior to ignore binary files rather than exiting.
	Merged Unix and Apple IIgs versions.

=========
Compiling:
=========

There are two makefiles included:
	Makefile.gs	- for use on the Apple IIgs running Gno
	Makefile.unix	- for use with Unix systems.

Although udl on the IIgs can be run from either Gno or Orca shells,
it cannot be built with the standard Orca installation due to a lack
of additional libraries.

Before you type "make", have a look at the Makefile and edit the defines
to your liking.

Also, udl.c assumes that getopt() is declared in <unistd.h> and that
the function strdup() exists in <string.h>. You might want to change
these includes if that's not the case.
