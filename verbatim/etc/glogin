# Versions of gsh prior to 2.0d4 always parsed the PATH environment variable
# backwards.  As of v2.0d4, gsh will parse PATH backward if and only if the
# OLDPATHMODE environment variable is set.
#
# For the moment, we still have gsh using its old behavior because some
# programs (notably dmake(1)) are currently compiled to expect this behavior.
# After these programs are updated, this environment variable should no longer
# be set.
