.TH REBOOT 8 "4 October 1997" GNO "System Administration"
.SH NAME
.BR reboot ,
.BR halt
\- stopping and restarting the system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR "halt -nq"
.br
.BR "reboot -nq"
.br
.BR "fasthalt -nq"
.br
.BR "fastboot -nq"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR halt
and
.BR reboot
utilities flush the file system cache to disk, send all running processes
a SIGTERM (and subsequently a SIGKILL) and, respectively, halt or restart
the system.
The action is logged, including entering a shutdown record into the login
accounting file.
.LP
The options are as follows:
.RS
.IP \fBn\fR
If the
.BR n
option is specified,
the file system cache is not flushed.
This option should probably not be used.
.IP \fBq\fR
If the
.B q
option is specified,
the system is halted or restarted quickly and ungracefully, and only
the flushing of the file system cache is performed.
This option should probably not be used.
.RE
.LP
The
.BR fasthalt
and
.BR fastboot
utilities are nothing more than aliases for the
.BR halt
and
.BR reboot
utilities.
.LP
Normally, the
.BR shutdown (8)
utility is used when the system needs to be halted or restarted, giving
users advance warning of their impending doom.
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR utmp (5),
.BR boot (8),
.BR shutdown (8),
.BR sync (8)
.SH HISTORY
A
.BR reboot
command appeared in Version 6 AT&T UNIX.
