This is a quick and dirty program intended to rename /RAM5 at
boot time.

See the man page for details.

If you decide to launch this program automatically from ProSel-16
(as I do), ensure you change the file type to S16, otherwise ProSel
will always prompt you when it is done ... most annoying.

This program is in the public domain.
