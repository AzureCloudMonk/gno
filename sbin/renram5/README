This is a quick and dirty program intended to rename /RAM5 at boot time.
Why do we bother?  Well, many GNO utils make use of '/tmp' (which by
default resides on the '/' partition via /etc/namespace mappings) for
scratch files.  This "partition" should therefore be on a fast disk.
A RAMDisk is a logical choice; not only is it fast, but it also is
empty after each power-on.

See the man page for usage information.

If you decide to launch this program automatically from ProSel-16
(as I do), ensure you change the file type to S16, otherwise ProSel
will always prompt you when it is done ... most annoying.

This program is in the public domain.
