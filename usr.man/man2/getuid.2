.BR geteuid
\- get user identification
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <sys/types.h>
.br
#include <unistd.h>
.sp 1
uid_t
.BR getuid (void);
.br
uid_t
.BR geteuid (void);
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR getuid 
function returns the real user ID of the calling process.
The
.BR geteuid 
function
returns the effective user ID of the calling process.
.LP
The real user ID is that of the user who has invoked the program.
As the effective user ID
gives the process additional permissions during
execution of
.I set-user-ID
mode processes,
.BR getuid 
is used to determine the real-user-id of the calling process.
.SH ERRORS
The
.BR getuid 
and
.BR geteuid 
functions are always successful, and no return value is reserved to
indicate an error.
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR getgid (2),
.BR setreuid (2)
.SH STANDARDS
.BR Geteuid 
and
.BR getuid 
conform to IEEE Std 1003.1-1988 (POSIX).
