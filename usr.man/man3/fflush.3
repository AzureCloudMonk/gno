.TH FFLUSH 3 "15 September 1997" GNO "Library Routines"
.SH NAME
.BR fflush ,
.BR fpurge
\- flush a stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <stdio.h>
.sp 1
int \fBfflush\fR (FILE *\fIstream\fR);
.br
int \fBfpurge\fR (FILE *\fIstream\fR);
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function
.BR fflush 
forces a write of all buffered data for the given output or update
.I stream
via the stream's underlying write function.
The open status of the stream is unaffected.
.LP
If the
.I stream
argument is
.BR NULL ,
.BR fflush 
flushes
.IR all 
open output streams.
.LP
The function
.BR fpurge 
erases any input or output buffered in the given
.IR stream .
For output streams this discards any unwritten output.
For input streams this discards any input read from the underlying object
but not yet obtained via
.BR getc (3);
this includes any text pushed back via
.BR ungetc .
.SH RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion 0 is returned.
Otherwise,
.BR EOF
is returned and the global variable
.IR errno
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.RS
.IP \fBEBADF\fR
.I Stream
is not an open stream, or, in the case of
.BR fflush ,
not a stream open for writing.
.RE
.LP
The function
.BR fflush 
may also fail and set
.IR errno
for any of the errors specified for the routine
.BR write (2).
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR write (2),
.BR fopen (3),
.BR fclose (3),
.BR setbuf (3)
.SH STANDARDS
The
.BR fflush 
function
conforms to ANSI/C.
