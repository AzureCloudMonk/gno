.SH NAME
.BR bcopy
\- copy byte string
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <string.h>
.sp 1
void
\fBbcopy\fR (const void *\fIsrc\fR, void *\fIdst\fR, size_t \fIlen\fR);
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR bcopy 
function
copies
.I len
bytes from string
.I src
to string
.IR dst .
If
.I len
is zero, no bytes are copied.
.LP
The two strings may overlap.  This is different than the implementation of
.BR bcopy
in versions of GNO prior to v2.0.6; 
.BR bcopy 
is no longer implemented in terms of 
.BR memcpy .
.SH SEE ALSO

.BR memcpy (3),
.BR memmove (3),
.BR strcpy (3),
.BR strncpy (3)
.SH HISTORY
