.SH NAME
.BR sleep
\- suspend process execution for interval of seconds
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <unistd.h>

unsigned int
\fBsleep\fR (unsigned int \fIseconds\fR);

function
suspends execution of the calling process
for
.I seconds
of time.
System activity or time spent in processing the
call may lengthen the sleep by a second.
Because scheduled wakeups occur at fixed 1-second intervals, the
actual suspension time may also be up to 1 second less than requested.

and
.BR sigpause (2).
.SH RETURN VALUES
This implementation of 
.BR sleep 
always returns zero.
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR sigpause (2)
.SH HISTORY
A
.BR sleep 
function appeared in v7.
