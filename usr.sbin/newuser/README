In order to run newuser/newuserv, the following files must exist.  They
are installed as part of the GNO base distribution, but you may have to
install them manually if you received newuser/newuserv as a standalone
archive:

/home
	A directory.  All user home directories will be created in this
	directory.
/var/adm/newuser/newid:
	A text file containing the next UID that newuser/newuserv
	should assign.
/var/adm/newuser/skel:
	A directory.  All plain files in this directory will be copied
	into a user's $HOME directory, when $HOME is created.  It is normal
	to have a skelton glogin and gshrc in here.
