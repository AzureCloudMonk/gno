After running the 'install' program, you need to create the files
/var/adm/newuser/newid and /var/adm/newuser/gshrc.  The latter is simply
a template gshrc file that all new users will be given.  The former is
a file with a single integer (1-5 digits) and *nothing else*.  New users
will be assigned the userid found in this file each time newuser is run,
and the userid will be automatically incremented by newuser.  So you only
have to set it up once.
