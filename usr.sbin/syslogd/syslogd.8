reads its configuration file when it starts up and whenever it
receives a hangup signal.
For information on the format of the configuration file,
see
.BR syslog.conf (5).
.LP
.BR Syslogd
reads messages from the
.B UNIX
domain socket
.BR /dev/log ,
from an Internet domain socket specified in
.BR /etc/services ,
and from the special device
.BR /dev/klog
(to read kernel messages).
.LP
.BR Syslogd
creates the file
.BR /var/run/syslog.pid ,
and stores its process
id there.
This can be used to kill or reconfigure
.BR syslogd .
.LP

.BR syslogd
should consist of a single line.
The message can contain a priority code, which should be a preceding
decimal number in angle braces, for example,

This priority code should map into the priorities defined in the
include file
.BR <sys/syslog.h> .
