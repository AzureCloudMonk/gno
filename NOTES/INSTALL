Installing the Binaries-Only Version
====================================

Make a copy of your disks.

	Make a copy of the GNO distribution disks and keep the originals in
	a safe place.  Never modify the original disks; only modify copies.

Define your destination directories.

	Using any text editor, edit the file /gno.disk1/installbin.  In 
	that file you will find the shell variables VOL1, VOL2, VOL3
	and VOL4.  You should change the values of these variables 
	to volume or directory names that exist at your site.

	While the distributed script used the same directory for
	all of VOL1 (/), VOL2 (/usr), and VOL3 (/home), I recommend
	placing them on different partitions if possible, especially
	the first two.  This is because, as you add more things to
	GNO, the / and /usr partitions will (likely) eventually use
	up most of a 32Meg ProDOS partition.
