CHANGES
-------

2.0
	- Maintenance of nroff has been taken over by Devin Reade,
	  <gdr@myrias.com>
	- Fixed a significant number of memory trashing bugs with the
	  help of Insight.
	- Optimized for speed, mainly by translating some functions
	  into inline code via macros.
	- Prototyped, indented and otherwise cleaned up code.  Made use
	  of some GNO v2.0.6 libc routines to reduce source code size.
	- Indented source.

=== The remaining versions listed below were by Mike Horwath,		===
=== <mfrankow@seq.hamline.edu> and Jawaid Bazyar <bazyar@hypermall.com>	===

1.1p3.4
	Well, guess what?  I caused a hell of an error in the last
	version of this, and now it is fixed.  The problem stemmed
	from a library error and has been fixed.  All thanks to Jawaid
	for creating and fixing the error all by himself.  (no flame
	to ya Jawaid...heh)

1.1p3.3
        Fixed the problem with nroffing the LESS manpage.  I don't
	really know how the hell I fixed it, but that bug is now gone.
	I also optimized the source to a great extent.  There is no real
	speed increase in output, but the executable is MUCH smaller
	than the original posted version.  Enjoy.

4/21/92 jb
	Fixed double-line problem when redirecting and piping the output
	of nroff.  (It sticks \r's in the output text all over the place.
	I simply filter them out in prchar.)

[previous versions]
        Well, first release.  The versions suck for now till I can
	figure out a better way to do it.  It worked, but had bugs.
