nroff - Text Processing Typesetter
----------------------------------

	This is 'nroff 1.2' for GNO/ME 1.0.  This is fairly close to
	the real Unix nroff, although there are still some things that
	this one doesn't do that it should.

	This software was ported by Mike Horwath and Jawaid Bazyar for
	the GNO Multitasking Environment.  Various bug fixes were applied
	by Devin Reade.

Installation
------------

	Type 'dmake install' in this directory, or copy the following
	files:

		nroff		-->	/usr/bin/nroff
		tmac.an		-->	/usr/lib/tmac/tmac.an
		tmac.s		-->	/usr/lib/tmac/tmac.s
		nroff.1		-->	/usr/man/man1/nroff.1
		man.7		-->	/usr/man/man7/man.7
		ms.7		-->	/usr/man/man7/ms.7

	If you want to put the macro files somewhere other than in
	/usr/lib/tmac, then set your TMACDIR environment variable to
	point to the directory in which they reside.

Compatibility
-------------
	This software works with any GNO-compatible shell (Orca suffices,
	but pipes don't work very well under Orca, and according to
	dozens of GNO users, GNO is "simply superior".)

Bugs
----
	This program uses recursion, Not A Good Thing on the IIgs.
	It really needs a rewrite.
