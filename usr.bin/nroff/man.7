.SH NAME
man - nroff macro package for manual pages
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR nroff
.BR -man
.IR file ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
These macros are used to lay out reference pages for manuals.
.PP
Any text argument
.I t
may be zero to six words.
Quotes may be used to include blanks in a 'word'.
Text
can be empty, but unlike normal Unix macros, the next line is not used.
.PP
A prevailing indent distance is remembered between successive
indented paragraphs, and is reset to default value upon
reaching a non-indented paragraph (i.e. at .SH or .SS).
In contrast with normal Unix procedure, all indents (tabs) are 8 spaces
instead of 5.
This can be changed by modifying tmac.an.
.SH "REQUEST SUMMARY"
.nf
.cc +
Request        Cause    Explanation
               Break?

.B t ...       no	Text \fIt\fR and subsequent arguments
			are bold.  Quote to imbed blanks.
			There is no intervening space.
.I t ...       no	Text \fIt\fR and subsequent arguments
			are italic.  Quote to imbed blanks.
			There is no intervening space.
.R t ...       no	Text \fIt\fR and subsequent arguments
			are roman.  Quote to imbed blanks.
			There is no intervening space.
.BR t ...      no	Alternate bold and roman fonts for
			specified arguments.  There is no
			intervening space.
.RB t ...      no	Alternate roman and bold fonts for
			specified arguments.  There is no
			intervening space.
.IR t ...      no	Alternate italic and roman fonts for
			specified arguments.  There is no
			intervening space.
.RI t ...      no	Alternate roman and italic fonts for
			specified arguments.  There is no
			intervening space.
.LP            yes      Begin paragraph. Set prevailing
                        indent to 8.
.PP            yes      Same as .LP.
.IP x          yes      Set prevailing indent to 8. Begin
                        indented paragraph with hanging tag
                        given by first argument. Tag \fIx\fR is
                        always placed on a separate line.
.TP x          yes	Same as .IP.  Note that this is a deviation from
			normal Unix usage.  This macro should be avoided
			until it is fixed.
.HP            yes	Indented paragraph without tag.
.RE            yes      End of relative indent. Set prevailing
                        indent to amount of starting .RS.
.RP x          yes      Like .IP, but use relative indent. Must
                        end the section with .RE.
.RS            yes      Start relative indent, move left margin
                        in distance 8.
.SH t          yes      Subhead. Quote to imbed blanks.
.SS t          yes      Subsection. Quote to imbed blanks. No
                        indent for \fBt\fR.
.TH n s d v c  yes      Begin page named \fIn\fR of chapter number \fIs\fR.
			\fId\fR is the date of the most recent change
			or the current date (prefixed by
			"\fBPrinted:\fR") if not specified.  \fIv\fR is the
			version number, or \fBGNO\fR if not specified.
			\fIc\fR is the chapter name.  If \fIc\fR is not
			specified, it is derived based on the
			value of \fIs\fR.
                        Sets prevailing indent and tabs to 8.
.EX            no	Exit now, leaving no extra space the
			end of the document.

.TH DEMO 1 "\\\|*\|(DA" "Version 1.0" "Commands Manual"
.SH NAME
demo - show how to use -man package  \\\|" this is a comment
.SH SYNOPSIS
demo [options] file [...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a test for showing how to use the
.I nroff(1)
man package.
It shows how to use .TH, .SH, .PP, .I, and .IP commands.
.PP
This will be a new paragraph.
You can also use normal
.I nroff(1)
commands in the text.
.SS NROFF COMMANDS:
.IP '\\\\\|"'
This is the comment command.
Note how you have to quote this sucker!
You'll probably never have to write an
.I nroff(1)
manpage, so don't worry about it.
.IP nf
No fill mode (the normal mode is fill mode where things
get justified right and left).
.IP fi
Re-enter fill mode.
.IP br
Break line here no matter what.
.IP sp
Vertical space (also causes a break to occur).
.sp
Note that to continue an indent and make a new paragraph (as
is the case here), just put in a space (.sp).
.PP
Now we should be at a new paragraph.
