NAME
	alarm - alarm clock reminder

SYNOPSIS
	alarm [+]#### [<delay> ["<message>"]]

DESCRIPTION
	alarm is a reminder program. Typically it is executed in the
	background. The program sleeps until the alarm time, and so
	uses very little CPU.

	The first argument defines the time, or time delay, for the
	alarm to ring. It must consist of an optional leading plus
	sign followed by four decimal digits. If the plus sign is
	present the alarm will ring in 'hhmm' hours. If the plus sign
	is absent, the alarm will ring at time 'hhmm' in 24-hour
	format. The alarm rings five times, each time delivering a
	beep, with beeps two seconds apart. The second argument, if
	present, changes the time between beeps. The third argument,
	if present, is echoed to stdout after each beep as a reminder
	message.

EXAMPLES
	alarm +0080 5 "Your TV show is on in five minutes" &
		rings the bell every five seconds and delivers the
		message eighty minutes after the current time.

	alarm 1955
		rings the bell every two seconds at 7:55 PM
