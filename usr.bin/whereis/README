whereis v1.1 (Gno)

============
INSTALLATION
============

If you have Gno and dmake, type "dmake install".  Otherwise:

                FILE:                   COPY TO:

        Gno:    Orca/whereis            17/whereis              [if desired]
                Gno/whereis             /usr/bin/whereis
                whereis.1               $(USRMAN)/man1/whereis.1

        Orca:   Orca/whereis            17/whereis
                whereis.cat             17/help/whereis

=====
NOTES
=====

Whereis is VERY dependant on pathnames.

This archive consist of both Orca shell and Gno versions.  Both versions
will work with both shells, the difference being that in the Gno version
the leading "31" has been stripped from pathnames.  (It is no longer needed
because of namespace.)

I strongly recommend _not_ using the Gno version with the Orca shell unless
you have actual partitions named "/usr", "/bin", "/etc", and so on, as you
will get _many_ accesses to all online devices in this case.

A -V flag and rVersion resource have been added to show version information.

A -c flag has been added to provide case-insensitive searches.

The source is released because it is small, and you can change the pathnames
if you wish.
