Changes:
=======

v1.1: (29 May 94)
	Makewhatis will now ignore any man page starting with ".so", in
	order to eliminate multiple files.  The resultant blank lines in
   the whatis database have therefore been eliminated.

   Changed -v flag to {-v1|-v2} for differing stages of verbosity.
   Only error output will be logged with the -l flag.

   Manual page was updated, to include a correction to the -o flag usage
   and the modification to the -v flag.  Descriptions of bugs unlikely
   to be fixed were added.  Date and version were changed.

	Fixed bug where input buffer wasn't properly terminated, and added
   checks for buffer overflows.

   Makewhatis will now display all commands about which the manual page
   is written.  For example, if foo.1 described both foo(1) and bar(1),
   and bar.1 was an .so (or .l) link to foo.1, then the database entry
   will have changed from
	   foo (1)					- extract and add thingys from the bork stream
   to
	   foo, bar (1)			- extract and add thingys from the bork stream

   Makewhatis used to pick up the first NAME string in the file as a reference
   point.  Now, any NAME is ignored in any line starting with .\" or .TH

	Filename chapter numbers will now be correctly extracted regardless of the
   existence of .Z, .z, .F, or .f suffixes, or of the existence of '.' within
   the base file name.

   Makewhatis is now linked with Soenke's gnulib for the getopt() function,
   rather than using the libc version.

	Stack usage was reduced to 1k.  Be aware, though, that a fair amount
   of global storage is used, including three 1k buffers.

v1.0: (15 May 94)
	Initial release.
