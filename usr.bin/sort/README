This archive contains the utilities msort(1) and dsort(1).  Both sort
text files lexicographically.

Msort is a fast in-place memory sort.

Dsort is a disk based sort that can handle "arbitrarily large" files
(in reality, limited to ULONG_MAX -- 4 294 967 295 -- bytes).

The big difference between these sorts and the previously available
sort(1) is that these won't crash your system ... if either run into
problems, they exit gracefully and (if you are using the verbose flag)
tell you what the problem is.

Enjoy.
