#  Name of gsh script containing test cases
set command="dotests"
#  Sometimes the file type is modified by editing; make it executable
chtyp -l exec $command

#  Filenames for raw and modified results
set raw_file="/tmp/rawlist"
set result_file="test.list"

#  Location of tr command that knows how to handle classes
set trcmd="/dist/bin/tr"

# --- Begin the tests ---

echo -n "Executing test script \"$command\" from directory "
pwd

# Create a new gsh invocation and record all I/O
echo "$command ; exit" | script $raw_file

# Clean up control characters
echo "Done with tests. Removing control characters from results file"
$trcmd -c -ds '[:print:]\r'  '\r'  < $raw_file > $result_file

echo "Tests results have been saved as \"$result_file\""
