CALENDAR(1)                                                        CALENDAR(1)

NAME
     calendar - reminder service

SYNOPSIS
     calendar

DESCRIPTION
     calendar consults the file calendar in the current directory and prints
     out lines that contain today's or tomorrow's date anywhere in the line.
     Most reasonable month-day dates such as ``Aug. 24,'' ``august 24,''
     ``8/24,'' etc., are recognized, but not ``24 August'' or ``24/8''.  On
     weekends ``tomorrow'' extends through Monday.

BUGS
     calendar's extended idea of ``tomorrow'' does not account for holidays.
