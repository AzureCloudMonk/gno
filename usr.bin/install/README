As the describe file says, install(1) is a utility similar to cp(1),
except that it does a few more things and is intended for use in
makefiles and scripts.

To install install, type "dmake doinstall".  By default, it places the
binary in /usr/bin and the man page in /usr/man/man1.  If you don't
like these locations, either modify the makefile or copy the two files
by hand.  There are no support files.

As usual, please email me or post to comp.sys.apple2.gno if you
encounter problems or bugs.
