As the describe file says, install(1) is a utility similar to cp(1),
except that it does a few more things and is intended for use in
makefiles and scripts.

To install install, type "dmake install".  By default, it places the
binary in /usr/bin and the man page in /usr/man/man1.  If you don't
like these locations, either modify the makefile or copy the two files
by hand.  There are no support files.  [Note:  As of v1.1, the
assumption is that you're building these files from within the GNO
base source hierarchy.]

As usual, please email me or post to comp.sys.apple2.gno if you
encounter problems or bugs.

CHANGE LOG
==========

v1.2	April 1998
	- Added sessions to (hopefully) speed things up.
	- Increased to use optimization level -1.  It seems to work.
	- Added the -V (verbose) flag.

v1.1	August 1997
	- Incorporated install(1) into base GNO v2.0.6 distribution
	- Use the GNO v2.0.6 libcontrib library
	- Symbolic mode arguments now use mode 0000 as a starting point,
	  rather than the original file mode.  This corresponds to the
	  usual UNIX usage.

	- Initial Version
