catrez -- concatenate resource forks from files

$Id: README,v 1.2 1997/09/26 06:31:15 gdr Exp $

DESCRIPTION
===========

catrez concatenates resources from multiple files into the resource fork of
a single file. (The data fork of the destination file is not modified.) This
is useful to programmers who create resources for a program in several
different files and need to combine them into the resource fork of the final
executable file. 

See the man page for details.

INSTALLATION
============

Method 1:

	dmake install

Method 2:

	cp catrez   /usr/local/bin
	cp catrez.1 /usr/man/man1


OTHER FILES
===========

The ORCA/C source file for catrez is included (catrez.c), as well as the
REZ source code (version.rez) and the "dmake" file (makefile.mk).

CHANGES
=======

v1.0.2	catrez was incorporated into the GNO base distribution.  Changes
	were:
		modified version number;
		new Makefile;
		renamed the rVersion resource file;
		minor formatting differences to the man page; and
		addition of a describe entry.
