catrez -- concatenate resource forks from files


DESCRIPTION
===========

catrez concatenates resources from multiple files into the resource fork of
a single file. (The data fork of the destination file is not modified.) This
is useful to programmers who create resources for a program in several
different files and need to combine them into the resource fork of the final
executable file. 

See the man page for details.

NOTE -- version 1.0.1 fixes a problem found in 1.0: resources with the
        "protected" attribute set were not copied correctly.


INSTALLATION
============

Method 1:

	dmake install

Method 2:

	cp catrez   /usr/local/bin
	cp catrez.1 /usr/man/man1


OTHER FILES
===========

The ORCA/C source file for catrez is included (catrez.c), as well as the
REZ source code (version.rez) and the "dmake" file (makefile.mk).
