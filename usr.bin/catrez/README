catrez -- concatenate resource forks from files

$Id: README,v 1.3 1997/09/30 05:14:47 gdr Exp $

DESCRIPTION
===========

catrez concatenates resources from multiple files into the resource fork of
a single file. (The data fork of the destination file is not modified.) This
is useful to programmers who create resources for a program in several
different files and need to combine them into the resource fork of the final
executable file. 

See the man page for details.

INSTALLATION
============

catrez is distributed with GNO version 2.0.6, so it should already be
included in your /usr/bin directory. If it isn't, you can copy the
executable and manual files from this archive:

	cp catrez   /usr/local/bin
	cp catrez.1 /usr/man/man1


OTHER FILES
===========

The ORCA/C source file for catrez is included (catrez.c), as well as the
REZ source code (catrez.rez), the "dmake" file (Makefile), and the
"describe" data base entry (catrez.desc).

Note: Makefile invokes the standard GNO program makefile /src/gno/prog.mk


CHANGES
=======

v1.0.2	catrez was incorporated into the GNO base distribution.  Changes
	were:
		modified version number;
		new Makefile;
		renamed the rVersion resource file;
		minor formatting differences to the man page; and
		addition of a describe entry.
	(Devin Reade <gdr@eddore.myrias.com>)
		print error messages on stderr instead of stdout
		use standard parsing of command-line options
	(Dave Tribby <tribby@cup.hp.com>)

v1.0.1	Resources with the "protected" attribute set were not copied correctly.

v1.0	Initial version.

THANKS
======

To Devin Reade and Soenke Behrens for their many contributions to the
Apple IIGS programming community that make creating programs easier.
Among their various tools, Devin's dmake and Soenke's occ have helped
me on many large and small programming projects.

To Steve Reeves (stever@gate.net) for finding a problem with resources
that have the protected attribute set, and sending the code to fix
the problem.
