NAME  
        colcrt - filter nroff output for CRT previewing 

SYNOPSIS  
        colcrt [ - ] [ -2 ] [ file ... ] 
        colcrt -V 

DESCRIPTION  
        Colcrt   provides   virtual  half-line  and  reverse  line  feed
        sequences for terminals without such capability,  and  on  which
        overstriking is   destructive.      Half-line   characters   and
        underlining (changed to dashing `-') are placed on new lines  in
        between the normal output lines.  

OPTIONS  

        -  
                Suppress all  underlining.    This  option is especially
                useful for previewing allboxed tables from tbl(1). 

        -2  
                Causes all half-lines to be printed, effectively  double
                spacing the  output.    Normally, a minimal space output
                format is used which will suppress  empty  lines.    The
                program  never  suppresses  two consecutive empty lines,
                however.  The -2 option is useful for sending output  to
                the  line  printer when the output contains superscripts
                and subscripts which would otherwise be invisible.  

        -V  
                Prints version information and exits.  

EXAMPLES  
        A typical use of colcrt would be 

        tbl exum2.n | nroff -ms | colcrt - | more 

BUGS  
        Should fold underlines onto blanks even with  the  -  option  so
        that a true underline character would show.  

        Can't back up more than 102 lines.  

        General  overstriking  is  lost;  as a special case | overstruck
        with - or underline becomes +. 

        Lines are trimmed to 132 characters.  

        Some provision should be made for  processing  superscripts  and
        subscripts in documents which are already double-spaced.
