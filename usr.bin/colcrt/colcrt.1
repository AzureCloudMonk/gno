.SH NAME
.B colcrt
\- filter nroff output for CRT previewing
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B colcrt
[
.B \-
]
[
.B \-2
]
[
.IR file " ..."
]
.br
.B colcrt
.B \-V
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Colcrt
provides virtual half-line and reverse line feed sequences
for terminals without such capability, and on which overstriking
is destructive.
Half-line characters and underlining (changed to dashing `\-')
are placed on new lines in between the normal output lines.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fB\-\fP
Suppress all underlining.
This option is especially useful for previewing
.I allboxed 
tables from
.BR tbl (1).
.IP \fB\-2\fP
Causes all half-lines to be printed, effectively double spacing the output.
Normally, a minimal space output format is used which will suppress empty
lines.
The program never suppresses two consecutive empty lines, however.
The
.B \-2
option is useful for sending output to the line printer when the output
contains superscripts and subscripts which would otherwise be invisible.
.IP \fB\-V\fR
Prints version information and exits.
.SH EXAMPLES
A typical use of
.B colcrt
would be
.sp
.B "tbl exum2.n \&| nroff \-ms \&| colcrt \- \&| more"
.SH BUGS
Should fold underlines onto blanks even with the
.B \-
option so that
a true underline character would show.
.LP
Can't back up more than 102 lines.
.LP
General overstriking is lost;
as a special case
.B \&|
overstruck with
.B \-
or underline becomes
.BR \&+ .
.LP
Lines are trimmed to 132 characters.
.LP
Some provision should be made for processing superscripts and subscripts
in documents which are already double-spaced.
.SH HISTORY
The
.B colcrt
command appeared in
3.0BSD.
.SH ATTRIBUTIONS
This command was ported from FreeBSD source code
for distribution with GNO/ME 2.0.6.
