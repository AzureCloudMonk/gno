# If test resource files aren't present, create them before running
# this script.
#  NOTE: should be able to simply call dmake, but that hasn't worked
#        on my GS. Your results may vary...but the following method
#        has worked: create command file via dmake, then execute it.
## rm -f /tmp/makerez
## dmake -n > /tmp/makerez
## chtyp -l exec /tmp/makerez
## /tmp/makerez
