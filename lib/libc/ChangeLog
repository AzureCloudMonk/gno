Since beta-970304: (Devin Reade, <gdr@myrias.com>)

	Added the following routines to the build:
	- the fts*(3) family of routines
	- fdopen(3) (doesn't appear to be working yet)
	- fgetln(3) hack
	- chmod(2)
	- fchmod(2)
	- the queue(3) family of macros
	- psignal(3), with sys_signame, sys_siglist arrays
	
	Use sys_nerr and sys_errlist from libc vice ORCALib by eliminating
	the _gno_ prefix.

	Changed NSIG in <sys/signal.h> to 32 vice 31; sys_siglist is a
	character array from zero to 31, inclusive.

	Added various library test programs.
	
	Added in conchecks in sys/trap.asm, sys/trap.mac, sys/syscall.c
	to ensure that the GNO kernel is indeed running and is at least
	the minimum required for the call.  This is currently disabled
	(by changing the macro in sys/trap.mac and conditional compilation
	in sys/syscall.c) due to performance concerns raised on the 
	gno-devel mailing list.

	Added the ChangeLog file.
