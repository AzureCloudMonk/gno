21 September 1997: (Devin Reade, <gdr@eddore.myrias.com>)
	Added man pages for:
	  rename(2), clearerr(3), ecvt(3), fclose(3), fflush(3), fgets(3),
	  fputs(3), fread(3), fseek(3), funopen(3), getc(3), isblank(3),
	  isinf(3), printf(3), putc(3), remove(3), scanf(3), setbuf(3),
	  stdio(3), ungetc(3),  (plus .so links)
	Modified fcntl(2) man page to mention limitations in current GNO
	  implementation.
	In the fcntl(2) stub, work around a kernel bug when getting flags
	  for char-special files.  This affects fdopen(3).
	Moved raise(3) implementation to ORCALib and ensured that backward
	  linking references are not made.
	Fixed popen(3)/pclose(3) implementation.  Added comment to man page
	  about occasional hanging problem that seems to be due to gsh(1).
	Added implementation, man pages for getlogin(2), and setlogin(2).
	Set the default optimization level to 78 from zero.

5 September 1997: (Devin Reade, <gdr@eddore.myrias.com>)

	Headers:
        - removed __ORCAC_VERSION macro from defaults.h
        - new stdio.h (BSD based)
        - new sane.h (from Soenke's lsaneglue)
        - new math.h (from ORCA/C, but added _isnan() and _isinf() 
                functions, and isnan() and isinf() macros).
        - added F_GETFL bit to sys/fcntl.h

	libc:
        - use BSD stdio implementation
        - added Soenke's _isfpe(), _isnan() routines (stdlib)
        - stdio now depends on lsaneglue
        - added non-ORCA rename(2) implementation
        - added sigprocmask(2)
        - changed unlink(2) not to depend on remove(3) [was briefly
          mutually recursive]
        - added fcntl(2)


Since beta-970304: (Devin Reade, <gdr@myrias.com>)

	Added the following routines to the build:
	- the fts*(3) family of routines
	- fdopen(3) (doesn't appear to be working yet)
	- fgetln(3) hack
	- chmod(2)
	- fchmod(2)
	- the queue(3) family of macros
	- psignal(3), with sys_signame, sys_siglist arrays
	
	Use sys_nerr and sys_errlist from libc vice ORCALib by eliminating
	the _gno_ prefix.

	Changed NSIG in <sys/signal.h> to 32 vice 31; sys_siglist is a
	character array from zero to 31, inclusive.

	Added various library test programs.
	
	Added in conchecks in sys/trap.asm, sys/trap.mac, sys/syscall.c
	to ensure that the GNO kernel is indeed running and is at least
	the minimum required for the call.  This is currently disabled
	(by changing the macro in sys/trap.mac and conditional compilation
	in sys/syscall.c) due to performance concerns raised on the 
	gno-devel mailing list.

	Added the ChangeLog file.
